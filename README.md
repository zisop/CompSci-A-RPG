Ideas:

<b>Bosses</b><br>
-- should spawn in mobs and die with those mobs<br>
-- should have attack patterns<br>
-- probably create a class for each boss<br>
-- bug caitlin for animations<br>

<b>Items</b><br>
-- finish the remaining rings<br>

<b>Editor</b><br>
-- allow for parsing of all types of characters<br>
-- allow for creation of chests with item bags<br>
  
<b>Mobs</b><br>
-- have death animations for each mob<br>
  
<b>Text</b><br>
-- allow player to click the textbox also
